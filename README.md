# ColorDots: The Nightmare after Memory

A Visually Clean Designed Memory Game, for Lovers of Nightmare after Christmas and all colors. 
It was build entirely in Vanilla JavaScript, and using CSS for styling and HTML as the mark-up. 
The goal is to find pairs of the same colors (watch out for similar colors in different tones, the game can be challenging!) and If you like an extra challenge, try to play it with the counter on, which will give you a maximum of two minutes to win the game!
